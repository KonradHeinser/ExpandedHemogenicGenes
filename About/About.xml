Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Have you ever thought that all you need in life is a little more blood? Don't worry, it's our little secret, and I'm here to grant your wishes. This mod adds 8 new genes that affect the hemogen gain multiplier, something usually only altered using the hemogen amplifier. Instead of adding to the multiplier though, this multiplies the multiplier, which means you will gain even more effects from the hemogen amplifier if you're using an efficient processing gene, while making them less effective if you are using an inefficient processing gene. Even if you don't use the amplifier, the gene will still help you gain more hemogen from various sources. 

For those using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997929736]More Hemogenic Genes[/url], as far as I know, these should not impact the rate that you passively regenerate hemogen. This means you can use that(or the all in one) to create a vampire that primarily uses themselves as a hemogen source.

Apologies for the lengthy names, I couldn't come up with anything better for them.

This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
